- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pat~!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Algorand, organisation, writing, and teaching. My dream is to help create an STG.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Reach, and working my way towards Python, Teal, and mastering my vim + colemak setup.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by sending an email to patto195@gmail.com


This is a work in progress profile - you can expect to see updates for the Reach Bounty Hack throughout early 2022, as well as my personal projects from March 2022. Many of these revolve around organisational tools I've implemented to help manage my life, as well as quality of life changes like Colemak or extend layers.
